Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Ensemble Methods
This project explores the use of ensemble machine learning algorithms for detecting fake news. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset, it applies techniques like Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, and Voting classifiers alongside Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify news articles as true or fake. Key steps include data preprocessing, linguistic feature extraction, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The study highlights the superior performance of SVM and ensemble learners, achieving up to 98.4% accuracy.
